# Why This Blog Exists

I'm a software engineer trying to become a software architect. This blog is where I document what I'm learning, share insights from real projects, and think through technical decisions out loud.

## What I Work On

At my day job, I build business applications and solve diverse engineering challenges—from system architecture to developer tooling to infrastructure migrations. Recently I led a TFVC to Git migration, which taught me more about organizational change than technical execution.

## What Changed

I recently realized that writing about what I learn:
- Solidifies my understanding
- Helps others facing similar challenges
- Creates a record of my growth

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Architecture patterns I'm learning
- Tools and automation experiments
- Technology evaluations
- Mistakes I've made (and what I learned)
- Experiments and side projects

## The Journey Ahead

I'm on the path to becoming a software architect. This blog is my way of learning in public.

Let's see where this goes.
